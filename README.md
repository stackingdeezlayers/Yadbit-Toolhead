# Yadbit-Toolhead

Yadbit is a unibody toolhead for Voron V0.2 printers and variants using MiniSB-style carriages. It’s built on Dragon Burner — originally starting from the Dragon Brick mod by [**ruiqimao**](https://github.com/ruiqimao) — with the initial goal of improving part cooling while still keeping it simple, compact, and easy to print.

Yadbit was made to be practical and clean — (hopefully) better cooling, less fuss, and easy to print. The layout places the hotend fan higher in the cowl, and the part cooling fans at a slight angle. Everything fits without travel loss on a V0.2, and it prints as a single piece. Visually, it takes **a lot** of inspiration from [**Yavoth**](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Yavoth) (another project from the great [**chirpy**](https://github.com/chirpy2605)).


## Design Goals
- Improved part cooling over the original Dragon Burner  
- Compatibility with most HF hotends (originally designed around the Rapido HF and Dragon UHF Mini)  
- 2510 hotend cooling  
- One-piece design for rigidity and simplicity  
- Maintain full travel on V0.2 printers  
- Printable with a **0.5 mm nozzle**


## Credits

Huge thanks to:  
- [**chirpy**](https://github.com/chirpy2605), for the original Dragon Burner and the Yavoth project  
- [**ruiqimao**](https://github.com/ruiqimao), for the Dragon Brick mod that this was originally based on  
- [**Armchair Heavy Industries**](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries), for the **Mantis Xol 2** (no, not the Xol Toolhead) — it inspired much of the duct design  


More updates to come — feedback is welcome.


(Fun fact: it's called Yadbit because I think that's how you'd pronounce _Y(et) A(nother) D(ragon) B(urner) T(ype) T(oolhead)_)
